Welcome to noodle's journey for the pursuit of knowledge! 

I am noodle, a rising high school sophomore interested in computational neuroscience! 

I am currently immersing myself in machine learning in the hopes of someday becoming proficient enough to employ my skills in the field. 

I am also learning more and more about neuroscience (and other material sciences as well).

I use obsidian, a zettlekasten-style note taking app to organize my life, and my notes will be available on this website soon on subjects from Earth Science to book notes.

Hope you'll stick around!
