# Who am I?

1. Erin Wong, a.k.a. noodle, a rising high school sophomore interested in computational neuroscience! 

2. Currently immersing myself in machine learning in the hopes of someday becoming proficient enough to employ my skills in the field. 

3. Learning more and more about neuroscience (and other material sciences as well).

I use obsidian, a zettlekasten-style note taking app to organize my life, and my notes will be available on this website soon on subjects from Earth Science to book notes.
